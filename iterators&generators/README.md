Iterators and Generators bring the concept of iteration directly into the core language and provide a mechanism for customizing the behavior of for...of loops.

**ITERATORS**:
  ‚óèWhen making an indsutry grade applications we usually use custom datatypes(trees, linked lists etc) to store our data  instead of builtin datatypes(arrays) so we cant use builtIn iterators(for...of)
  so we make our own iterators for our custom datatypes, while building this iterators we follow set of protocols called "iteration protocols"
